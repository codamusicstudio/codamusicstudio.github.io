		<h1>2015&ndash;2016 Special Events</h1>
		<p>Last year’s Lego practice incentive was a huge success. A few thousand Legos were earned and many interesting creations made at the party (see pictures on the <a href="./media.html">media</a> page). I’m not sure we will ever be able to top it, but, hopefully, this year’s incentive will prove to be as motivational. Students will be earning music money through a variety of activities and be able to spend it on small prizes or save it for bigger ones. We are also starting the One Minute Club to address the primary nemesis of all beginning piano students&mdash;learning to quickly identify notes on the grand staff and play them. This year’s events will also include more performance and party opportunities.</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h1>2014&ndash;2015 Special Events</h1>
		<p>This year younger students will be earning actual Lego blocks for their work in 4 categories&mdash;music theory, technique skills, printed music and music of their own creation. Later in the year we will have a Lego performance party and students will be able to create something using the Legos they have earned. The big recital will come the end of May as in years past.</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h1>2012&ndash;2013 Special Events</h1>
		<p>Last year's events were well received and will be repeated again this year with some significant improvements.  The full schedule can be found here: <a href="./documents/studio_events_calendar_2012-2013.pdf">Studio Events Calendar 2012&ndash;2013 (.pdf)</a></p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h1>2011&ndash;2012 Special Events</h1>
		<p>Special events for this school year included another skills contest (a rhythm bee&mdash;a spelling bee but with rhythms that must be accurately clapped), more nursing home performances and a couple of performance parties in addition to the spring recital.</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h1>2010&ndash;2011 Special Events</h1>
		<h2>Nail the Scale Contest</h2>
		<p>Our winter skills contest improved our understanding and ability to play scales. Students were placed in one of four levels and were graded on their speed and technique in playing the required scales. The top three in each level were awarded prizes.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Spring Recital</h2>
		<p>This year's recital again combined Coda Music Studio's students with the students of Mrs. Mott. The theme was "Pictures at an Exhibition" which reversed Mussorgsky's inspiration for his work by the same name. His music was inspired by his friend's art. We allowed our recital pieces to inspire original art which was shown during the recital and displayed at the reception.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Keyboard Conversation Concerts</h2>
		<p>Many students and their families attended one of three Keyboard Conversation concerts at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia. Concert artist, Jeffery Siegel, introduced each piece with interesting insight into its form and background before performing it. Students were given the option of earning part of the ticket price by doing extra credit work.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Nursing Home Performances</h2>
		<p>Four performances were scheduled at two local nursing homes giving students an opportunity to perform for an appreciative audience.</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h1>2009&ndash;2010 Special Events</h1>
		<h2>Note&ndash;Name Challenge</h2>
		<p>Our winter skills contest which tested how fast students could name treble and bass clef notes. Students competed in one of four different levels and prizes were awarded to the top three in each level. The fastest student named 25 notes in 40 seconds.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Spring Recital</h2>
		<p>In conjuction with Mrs. Mott.</p>
