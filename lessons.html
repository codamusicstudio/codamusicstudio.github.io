			<h1>Lessons</h1>

			<h1>Studio Policy</h1>

        	    	<span class="close">Close</span>
					<h2>Tuition</h2>
					<p>Tuition is due at the first lesson after receiving an invoice. Any payment not received by the second lesson after the date of the invoice will be considered late and will incur a late fee of $10.  A semester's tuition may be paid in 3 installments&mdash;every 4 weeks. All lesson tuition is non-refundable.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Music and Other Lesson Materials</h2>
					<p>Tuition does not cover the cost of music books, sheet music or other lesson materials. A $30 music book fee will be charged when lessons commence and again whenever that money has been exhausted. This fee should cover the cost of the basic books for the average student for the year.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Lesson Time</h2>
					<p>Payment of tuition reserves a spot on the lesson schedule the same time every week. Once a time slot has been assigned a change can be requested but changes can only be made if openings are available. I cannot guarantee that a request can be honored. Advance notice will help make this possible. If a student is more than 15 min. late and no one has called to say they are still coming the lesson is forfeited. If a student arrives late, their lesson will end at the scheduled time.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Summer Lessons</h2>
					<p>Students are encouraged to continue lessons over the summer to help maintain their skills between semesters. During the months of June, July and August individual lessons can be scheduled around vacations or students can take 1 or 2 electives which may be offered.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Holidays </h2>
					<p>Holiday breaks include Thanksgiving and around 2 weeks at Christmas/New Years. The studio will be open on all Monday holidays during the year except for Labor Day and Memorial Day.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Snow Days</h2>
					<p>I'm from Michigan and am not intimidated by snow and ice. The studio will be open even when schools close unless you are notified differently. The decision to close will be made a few hours before scheduled lessons based on current conditions and the forecast. Too often what is forecast the day before does not materialize or conditions that cause a school closing in the morning have changed by afternoon.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Vacations</h2>
					<p>Since family vacations sometimes occur during the school year, it is possible to make up a lesson if 1). The time away results in more than one missed lesson, 2). There is at least 4 weeks advance notice and 3). It is possible to mutually agree on a makeup date and time.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Make-up lessons </h2>
					<p>One make-up lesson is built into every semester. If more than one lesson is missed they will not be made up (except for a prearranged family vacation&mdash;see above) and no reimbursement will be given. If I have to cancel a lesson it will be made up at our mutual convenience. If that is not possible a credit will be given. Exceptions to this policy may be given in extenuating circumstances at my discretion. There is no need to cancel a lesson because of lack of practice due to illness or other unusual circumstance. There are many other skills that can be worked on at a lesson other than what has been assigned.</p>
					<br />
					<h2>Termination of Lessons</h2>
					<p>The parents, adult student or teacher may terminate lessons at any time with prior notification. However, refunds of tuition are NOT given. If you should decide to stop taking lessons, please give me a few weeks advance notice so I can bring the relationship to a positive close. A student may be dismissed for non-payment, excessive absences and lack of progress or unacceptable behavior. No student will be dismissed without ample warning.</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p class="italic">This policy may be amended occasionally as needed. Studio clients will be notified of such amendments via email at least 3 weeks prior to the effective date of the change. This form of notification shall be considered valid and binding on both parties.</p>
