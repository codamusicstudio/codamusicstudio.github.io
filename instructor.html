		<p>I began taking piano lessons at age six after my mother discovered that I could play the songs she was teaching my older brother. I continued lessons (piano and organ) for the next 18 years. I started accompanying school choirs in 5th grade and continued that into my college years as well.</p>
		<br />
		<p>When I entered junior high, I wanted to be in the band and orchestra so I started playing percussion. I loved marching band and was the drum major during my high school years.</p>

		<br />
		<p>During college, I continued with piano and organ lessons and also took percussion and voice lessons. I played in the percussion ensemble, sang in college choirs, accompanied some of those choirs and played percussion in the marching band.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Currently, in addition to teaching private lessons, I teach general music at Grace Christian School and am a substitute organist/pianist at area churches. I am married and have two married children and three grandchildren.</p>
